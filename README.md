> Learn best practices for releasing with Autify and CircleCI on your own

## Best practice

By running in regression testing prior to release, you can release new features more safely and confidently.You can automate that process by running an Autify regression test automatically when the features are merged into the master/develop branch in CircleCI.

## Setup

1. Set the following environment variables in CircleCI
     |environment variables|description|
     |---|---|
     | AUTIFY_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN |Personal Access Tokens generated by Autify's user settings page|
     | AUTIFY_PROJECT_ID |Project ID in Autify|
     | AUTIFY_TEST_PLAN_ID |The ID of the test plan you want to run in Autify|

1. Copy the necessary parts of [`.circleci/config.yml`](.circleci/config.yml) and change them accordingly.

      ```yml
      # Note: this file will run a regression when you merge it into the master branch
      workflows:
        version: 2
        commit-workflow:
          jobs:
            - publish-to-production:
                filters:
                  branches:
                    only: master
      ```
